A capstone is the culminating experience for students in the Master’s Degree in Computer Science. The capstone provides students with the opportunity to apply and integrate key concepts from each course in their program of study. Candidates must collaborate with their school community to identify an authentic and challenging technology-related need, problem, or research study to complete within the school, district or other educational agency. Working with faculty and relevant stakeholders, candidates must design, implement, and evaluate an appropriate solution to meet the need or problem.

## 3. Project Environment
####3.1 Back-End => Laravel5 (PHP):
Why Laravel? Well, technology moves pretty fast and it’s tough to keep up. Not only is it tough to keep up, but it is increasingly complex. Laravel strives to make moving forward with Web Development very simple. It is this unique combination of staying on the cutting edge of web based development with modern PHP, while also keeping things simple, that makes Laravel so attractive.

####3.2.a Front-End => AngularJS ( Front-End MVC Framework )
AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.
####3.2.b Front-End => Bootstrap ( Responsive Web Design Framework )
Bootstrap is an open source project originally created by Twitter to enable creation of responsive, mobile first web pages. Bootstrap has a standard set of classes that allow developers to quickly create applications that scale to devices of all sizes, and incorporate common components such as dialog boxes and validation. Bootstrap has become a standard for web design.
